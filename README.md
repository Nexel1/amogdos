# amogdos
A work in progress meme dos clone that has an amogus theme

Amogus is a dead meme now but still I wanna make it

Bootloader: Bootboot

No Kernel Design has been made probably requires a rewrite

Bootloader is made for microkernels but Amogdos kernel isn't really a microkernel (yet) due my lazyness in writing a filesystem driver but I will surely implement it soon as possible (after i implement threading cuz threads are essential for me lol)




Features:
|Feature|Does it work?|
|-------|-------------|
|Sound| Sort of only beeps|
|Keyboard| Well it is available to access but it is unfinished but driver works so|
|Memory management| buggy af but should work to some extent|
|Threads| Nope I couldn't figure out how to make threads properly|
|Sussyness| Yes only fully working feature amogus!|

Planned Features:
|Feature|Help Needed (true or false)|Will I implement before I die|
|-------|---------------------------|-----------------------------|
|Threading| A lot| Yes|
|Networking| I need someone to write networking driver I can't pull off myself it's super complicated| no|
|File system| Not rlly I can probably implement it myself| yeah definitely|
|Mouse| No it's super simple to implement| definitely sus|

anyways a wise man said "Amogus will never die, I will keep posting amogus forever", most of people think amogus is unfunny which it is but maybe we can turn something unfunny to funny with our efforts.
It's just made to fuel up amogus again lol.
